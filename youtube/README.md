# YouTube Data Directory

This directory is used to store files related to downloaded YouTube videos and other associated data.

## Contents

*   **videos:** This subdirectory stores downloaded YouTube video files in `.mp4` format.
*   **audio:** This subdirectory stores the extracted audio files from videos, in `.wav` format.
*   **dubs:** This subdirectory stores the generated transcriptions for the downloaded files, in `.txt` format.

## Purpose

This directory is managed by the YouTubeGPT application and should not be manually modified, unless for debugging purposes.

## Important Notes

*   Do not delete the folders or files, unless you are sure of what you are doing, as this may cause errors when running the application.
